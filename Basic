props: all about communicating data from parent to child
state:tracking a single piece of data that whenever changes we want to update what appears on screens

LECTURE 85:
React Navigation Fix
React Navigation has changed a bit since their recent v.4.0.0 release:

https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/v4.0.0

We must now install three libraries separately. In your terminal run the following command:

npx expo-cli install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-navigation-stack

Our imports in the upcoming lecture will now look like this:

import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';


TO install a screen make a new folder src/srcreens


to use an icon in an expo-cli project check for expo/vector-icons search for the symbol and use it as 
import {Feather} from '@expo/vector-icons';
inside jsx  <Feather name='search' size={30}/>



Anytime we want a make a network request from react native app we have many options: two of these are
1. fetch
2. axios

to insall axios

*/////////////any netwrok request is async operation.*///////////////
SEE LECTURE 95


We use useEffect hook to allow some piece of code to run only once when the app is ran first time. it takes two arguments
1.  useEffect(()=>{}) every time the component is rendered.
2.  useEffect(()=>{}, [])  run the arrow fxn only once when first rendered.
3.  useEffect(()=>{}, [value]), run at first render and every time the 'value' chnges

useEffect(()=>{
        searchApi('pasta');
      },[]);
